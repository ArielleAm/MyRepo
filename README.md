# Unclogging A Sink

If you notice that water is not draining from the basin of your sink at all or as quickly as it used to, something is likely blocking the flow of water. To clear it, you will need: 

* Screwdriver or metal coat hanger
* Wrench for tight bolts (depending on the cause of the problem)
* Flashlight 
 

**First, see if there is any hair in the drain. Stray hair and debris is more often the cause of a block and is easily fixed.**

Remove the stopper in your drain, then use a coat hanger or screw driver to clean any hair or debris that has become lodged between the stopper and the drain. For instructions on how to remove the stopper, see below. 


# **Removing a Stopper**

Not all stoppers are the same. Yours may screw off easily or it may appear stuck. This is because some are connected to the sink. 

If yours is the latter, then you will need to go under your sink and look for a metal arm (it should look like a lollipop with a stick coming out of both sides instead of one.) 

There is a nut that holds this arm in place. Once you have unscrewed and removed it, you should be able to move this metal arm out of the way and take your stopper out of the sink to clear the drain. 

When you are done, replace everything where you found it. 

***Tip: if you have trouble finding the arm, but have a lever near your faucet that you can pull up on to fill your basin, then follow that lever to under the sink. It will be connected to the arm you are looking for.***

# **Removing a Trap**

If the sink is still clogged after cleaning the drain, then the blockage may be in the trap. 

To take the trap off, you should look for a ‘U’ shaped pipe under the sink that is held up by two nuts. 

Remove the nut that connects the pipe to the sink by unscrewing it, and you should be able to look inside the trap and see if anything has been caught. 

You can clean this out with a coat hanger or screwdriver as with the drain. 

After re-attaching the bolt, the sink should drain properly. If it is still not draining, the problem may be deeper and you should call a plumber.
